This movie is the gift that keeps on giving.

>They were just explaining that I was going to have a raccoon on my head, controlling my body. We were workshopping how to run, how he would move. Then, when I read the script, I didn’t know exactly where this fell in line with the whole story, other than I’m playing it very genuinely and it’s about a guy who just has absolutely no confidence in what he’s doing and needs a creature that so many people are scared of.

>I lived in a house where raccoons would just start playing in the backyard at 1 in the morning. I used to work really late and I remember these two raccoons — I could hear them through my blinds. Apparently, they were foreplaying? It looked like they were about to get it on. I felt like this creeper watching them. But I couldn’t stop. And they both looked over at me and just stared at me to close the blinds and give them some privacy. You could hear the [imitates raccoon squealing] before I closed it because it looked like they were about to come in. I almost feel like you don't mess with raccoons, they don’t mess with you. Watch from a distance. So, the idea of putting it on top of your head is kind of the most intimate thing you could do. I was definitely breaking some rules there.

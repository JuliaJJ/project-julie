My piles of books to read generally fall into two categories - science fiction and cheesy romance. There are some strays sprinkled in there, like "American Prometheus," which I'd like to finish before *Oppenheimer* comes out in July (and if we were ranking things, the "nonfiction" category ). But... I've got my favorites. I've got comfort food. 

Like most romance novels, you know from the opening pages of "Yours Truly" that the two doctors at the center of the story are going to end up together; what sets my favorite romances apart is the journey.

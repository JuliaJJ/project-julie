Seeing this set being workshopped when he made a Denver stop in early 2022 didn't diminish the enjoyment of Bargatze's newest special. His jokes are delivered with his typical deadpan calm, riffing on his slightly bumbling everyman persona, and nearly every anecdote lends itself to becoming an entertaining episode of a single-camera sitcom. I consider myself pretty smart, and I still struggle with light switches _in my own home_, let alone in an unfamiliar environment like a hotel room. 

I wonder if he'll ever encounter that waitress that walked out after taking his family's dinner order, and I similarly wonder what took his wife so long to get to the golf course from the bathroom. In short, it didn't suck. (Language!)

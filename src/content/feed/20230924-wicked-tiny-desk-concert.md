It's become a bit of one of those "dislike this because it's popular" things, but I still am a sucker for singing along to "Wicked." I've seen the show three times, including once in London (no, you don't really hear the accents when they sing), and enjoyed it every time. Some of these songs will just always be classics in the pantheon of musical theatre.

And I can't hear "For Good" without belting along and crying just a little bit (and more if I'm missing a particular friend in the moment).

Up through the fourth or fifth grade, I was in dance classes almost every day of the week. Ballet, tap, jazz... I did it all. I was raised by an amazing single mom, but unfortunately she didn't have the greatest of jobs, and between the cost and moving out of the house I'd lived in since I was born, we couldn't keep up with the classes much longer after that. But I've always wished I had kept dancing, and I've got big plans to start taking classes again.

Every so often I fall down the rabbit hole of choreography videos on YouTube, and this is one of my favorites.

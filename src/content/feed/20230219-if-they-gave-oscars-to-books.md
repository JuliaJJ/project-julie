I seem to collect lists of books to read almost as fast as I collect books; I will never run out of recommendations. But this compendium calls out the imagined literary categories alongside them - Best Real-Life Main Character (I will talk about the toxicity of Colleen Hoover's novels to anyone who will listen), Best Setting (how many kids can say they put on plays in the skeleton of a whale?), Best Book Jacket Design, Best Book of Poetry... 

An entertaining way to find some gems you (and I) may have missed.

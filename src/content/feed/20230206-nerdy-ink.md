There's been a trend lately to curate Instagram-ready bookshelves, and while I can't get behind the stores that sell stacks of books organized by color strictly to be used as accessories rather than, you know, _for reading_, I can certainly get behind these beautifully illustrated book jackets. 

The Shadow and Bone trilogy is one of my favorite fantasy series from the last decade, but I've only got the books as digital copies at the moment. These dust jackets might convince me to track down used copies of the (I think) out-of-print hardcovers just to show them off.

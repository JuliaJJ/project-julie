Same song, different video. It's hitting with me right now.

There's something about live music. I love putting on my headphones and/or turning up the speaker volume and having a solitary musical experience - zoning out with the lights off, or dancing around the house, or scream-singing in the car. But sometimes... being in a crowd, for me, creates this simultaneous feeling of total anonymity and total community. Singing along, and hearing everyone around you doing the same? Chills.

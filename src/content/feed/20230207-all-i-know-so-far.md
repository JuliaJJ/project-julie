P!NK has an amazing voice. Kelly Clarkson has an amazing voice. I love this song because it gives me feels. 

This entire episode is worth a watch.  Kelly and P!NK have extended conversations about the stories behind each song and then they duet together, and it's just... fun. It reminds me of VH1 Storytellers and MTV Unplugged. Back when music channels played music.

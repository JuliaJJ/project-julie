excerpt: "The last year has been rough. Really rough. Tiny-boat-on-the-giant-wave-from-The-Perfect-Storm rough. I never doubted I would survive it, but I also didn't know how. By choice, I blew up my life. I don't regret it, but some of the challenges have been greater than expected. Some I'm still smack in the middle of, working my way through by following a poorly lit path."

The last year has been rough. Really rough. Tiny-boat-on-the-giant-wave-from-The-Perfect-Storm rough. I never doubted I would survive it, but I also didn't know how. By choice, I blew up my life. I don't regret it, but some of the challenges have been greater than expected. Some I'm still smack in the middle of, working my way through by following a poorly lit path. My heart is broken and battered, and I feel more than a little abandoned by people I love and trust. But! I'm also feeling a bit like the Little Engine That Could, and I'm hoping I'm near the top of the hill. When I get up there, I don't think I'll speed right down. It will be worth it to stop at the top, hold up train traffic a little, look behind me, and say, "That was a seriously fucking huge hill. I'm pretty awesome to have made it up." I believe in myself. I don't *think* I can - I *know* I can.

I always carry notepads with me. Always. Big ones in my backpack. Little ones in my purse. Extras in my luggage, in case I encounter a note-taking emergency. Yes, I could absolutely use my phone - but why, when I have decent handwriting and the gliding of pen on paper is so satisfying? I've been trying to work in self care to manage my way through this season - being horribly lazy and watching movies, retail therapy, trying to learn new things - and one thing that helps me stay focused instead of letting the hurt overwhelm me is my list of good things. I very creatively call it The Good List. Anytime something makes me smile, or makes me say, "Let's do that again," or makes me want to share myself with the world again - I add it to the list. And maybe sharing *the list* with the world could make someone else's day.

So, in progress, incomplete, in no particular order, evolving - here is The Good List so far:

cocktails with ingredients I can't pronounce garnished with edible flowers  
yoga that's basically just almost taking a nap  
bejeweled shoes
